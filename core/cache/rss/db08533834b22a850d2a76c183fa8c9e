We&#039;ve embarked on <a href="http://a11y.modx.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a mission to make the MODX Manager accessible for all</a> and we need your help. <br />
<br />
As you know, MODX has always stood for creative freedom. However, Revo’s Manager has failed to deliver that promise for all. People who use assistive technologies like screen readers, enlarged fonts and alternate input devices were never really given proper consideration. That must change. <br />
<br />
We want to make it right by making it possible for anyone to use MODX, no matter what. <br />
<br />
<strong>A Huge Head Start</strong><br />
We have already started research and development work on this important initiative thanks to $25,000 in funding from <a href="http://www.osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Ohio State University</a>. We’re looking to complete the effort by crowdfunding a matching amount. If only 1000 MODX community members and their clients donated $25, we’d reach our goal, virtually overnight. You can <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/a11y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">get directly involved</a>, too.<br />
 <br />
All funds raised will be used to dedicate development resources, expert consulting and user testing. <br />
 <br />
<strong>You Can Make a Difference</strong><br />
So please help us reach our goal so we can bring MODX to everyone. Take a minute (right now please!) to visit <a href="http://a11y.modx.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a11y.modx.com</a> and find the donation level that’s right for you. Any amount will make a difference, and it’s easy to support this very worthy cause. All donations over $25 are eligible for a variety of donor rewards including MODX stickers, shirts and hats exclusive to this campaign, and some really awesome Accessibility courses from <a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deque University</a>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Help Spread the Word</strong><br />
If you can’t support this initiative personally, but work with MODX professionally, we’d love to see your company or customers supporting the accessible MODX Manager project, too. It takes just a few seconds to forward this message along with a simple request from you.<br />
<br />
Further, we’d welcome translations to the accessibility campaign message; if you can help translate any of <a href="http://a11y.modx.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a11y.modx.com</a>, please get in touch. <br />

<strong>About Revolution 2.3</strong><br />
Revolution 2.3 features an elegantly refined and updated MODX Manager with an all-new theme designed by Peter Knight (aka eladnova). Build and manage your sites faster, and in a more user friendly and less intimidating workspace. Revolution 2.3 also introduces the Uberbar, which provides Manager users with global search within Resources, Elements and Users. Now, whatever you&#039;re looking for is at your fingertips.<br />
<br />
We have tried our best to encourage Extras authors to make sure their extras are up to date and compatible with 2.3, however, there may be extras that have not been tested. Before upgrading or starting a new project in Revolution 2.3, please take a look at <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/11630#issue-37173621" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this list of Extras confirmed to work with 2.3</a>. <br />

<strong>About Revolution 2.3</strong><br />
Revolution 2.3 features an elegantly refined and updated MODX Manager with an all-new theme designed by Peter Knight (aka eladnova). Build and manage your sites faster, and in a more user friendly and less intimidating workspace. Revolution 2.3 also introduces the Uberbar, which provides Manager users with global search within Resources, Elements and Users. Now, whatever you&#039;re looking for is at your fingertips.<br />
<br />
We have tried our best to encourage Extras authors to make sure their extras are up to date and compatible with 2.3, however, there may be extras that have not been tested. Before upgrading or starting a new project in Revolution 2.3, please take a look at <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/11630#issue-37173621" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this list of Extras confirmed to work with 2.3</a>. <br />

<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong><br />
We can&#039;t stress enough about the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX. While no software is 100% secure, staying on the most current version protects you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated unpatched software. If you&#039;re not sure what version of MODX Revolution you&#039;re running, login to your website Manager and go to Reports&gt;System Info and you should see it in the top section.<br />

If you need help upgrading your site, please contact your website builder, find a <a href="/modx.com/professionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Professional</a> or get in touch with <a href="/modx.com/support-and-services/services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Support</a>.<br />

<strong>Highlights of 2.2.15</strong><br />
Here are some of the highlights of 2.2.15:<ul class="dis-ul"><br />

It includes two security fixes including one affecting the phpThumb library that ships with Revo. In addition, it eliminates a bug that appeared in Google Chrome 32 and adds an alert notifying users to confirm navigation to prevent losing unsaved changes.<br />
<br />
As this release contains security fixes, we recommend upgrading all your sites. If you&#039;re using <a href="http://modxcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Cloud</a>, this just takes a couple clicks.<br />
<br />
2.3 is coming and we&#039;ll have an update on what we&#039;ve been up to, soon.<br />
<br />
Here are the highlights of changes in the 2.2.11 release:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
<li>Update phpThumb to 1.7.11-beta to close security vulnerability</li>
<li>Prevent XSS on actionVar in header.tpl in the Manager</li>
<li>Eliminate unwanted &quot;confirm navigation&quot; alerts in Chrome 32+</li>
<li>Added intentional &quot;confirm navigation&quot; to prevent loss of unsaved changes</li>
<li>Fix caching of manager menus. Until now, they may not have been ever cached</li>

If you&#039;ve not been to a MODXpo, this is the event for you.<br />
<br />
<strong>MODXpo 2013 Highlights</strong><br />
There are top-notch keynotes, presentations, workshops, and much more, from well known MODX community members including Susan Ottwell, Mark Hamstra and Gauke Pieter Sietzema. Ryan Thrash, MODX Co-founder, will present his State of MODX and showcase the past, present and future of MODX. Other great sessions include: responsive development tools, continuous deployment, scaling and high availability, how not to build MODX sites, case studies, contributing to MODX and much more. In addition, there will be plenty of time for making connections and code.<br />
